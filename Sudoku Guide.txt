Aim: 
To complete the grid of numbers 

Rules of the grid: 
All rows, columns and 3x3 squares must have only numbers 1-9 and each number must only appear once.

How to Play: 
To select a square on the grid, first enter the number of the column (1-9, with 1 on theleft & 9 on the right). Then enter number of the row (1-9, with 1 on the top and 9 on the bottom)
If you have selected that is blank(to be guessed), it will show with a red outline(Note: might not on first square selected)
Then enter your guess 1-9, if correct the number will show, if wrong the mistakes count will increase. 
When you have completed the grid, it should give your final time and mistake count. When finished close the window(no automatic close) 
(PLEASE NOTE: Entering a blank to any input will cause an error! Try not to let this happen)
